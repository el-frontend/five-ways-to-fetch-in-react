# Five Ways to Fetch Data in React

This template provides a minimal setup to get fetch data in React.

## The ways to fetch data in React

This project demonstrates five different ways to fetch data in React:

1. **Using the Fetch API**: This is the most basic way to fetch data in React. It involves using the Fetch API to make a request to a server and retrieve the data.

2. **Using Axios**: Axios is a popular HTTP client library that provides a convenient way to make requests to a server. It is similar to the Fetch API, but provides a more convenient API.

3. **Using the custom useFetch Hook**: The useFetch hook is a custom hook that encapsulates the logic of fetching data from a server. It is not as convenient as the other methods, but it provides a lot of flexibility.

4. **Using the useSWR Hook**: The useSWR hook is a React hook provided by the SWR library. It is a wrapper around the Fetch API that provides a convenient way to fetch data in React applications. It also provides a number of features such as caching and error handling.

5. **Using the useQuery Hook from React Query**: The useQuery hook is a React hook provided by the React Query library. It is a wrapper around the Fetch API that provides a convenient way to fetch data in React applications. It also provides a number of features such as caching and error handling.
